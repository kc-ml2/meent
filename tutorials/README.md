# Tutorials

## Modeling and Electromagnetic simulation
* [Modeling and EMsolver](01-modeling-and-emsolver.ipynb)
  * modeling and Electromagnetic simulation(Meent uses RCWA).

## Autograd and Optimization
* [Autograd and Optimization on JAX](02-autograd-and-optimization-jax.ipynb) or [Autograd and Optimization on PyTorch](02-autograd-and-optimization-pytorch.ipynb)
  * gradient and optimization with the help of Automatic Differentiation(a.k.a. backprop).
  * separately written for JAX and PyTorch backends for user convenience.
