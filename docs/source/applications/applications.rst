Applications
============

Meent is expected to be useful for solving inverse design and optimization
problems in OCD and metasurface design. In this section, we present some
exemplary cases where Meent proves its capabilities.
Leveraging the automatic differentiation function,
we successfully carry out optimization for diffraction gratings and
achieve inverse design of the geometric parameters.
