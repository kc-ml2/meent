Applications
============

`meent` is expected to be useful for solving inverse design and optimization
problems in OCD and metasurface design. In this section, we present some
exemplary cases where \texttt{meent} proves its capabilities.
Leveraging the automatic differentiation function,
we successfully carry out optimization for diffraction gratings and
achieve inverse design of the geometric parameters.
