# Examples

## Tutorial is (partially) ready! (though it deals only surface of Meent).

* [tutorial_01.ipynb](tutorial_01.ipynb)
  * modeling and Electromagnetic simulation(Meent uses RCWA).
* [tutorial_02_JAX.ipynb](tutorial_02_JAX.ipynb) or [tutorial_02_Torch.ipynb](tutorial_02_Torch.ipynb)
  * gradient and optimization with the help of Automatic Differentiation(a.k.a. backprop).
  * separately written JAX and Torch backends for user convenience.
