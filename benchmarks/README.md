# Benchmark
Compare Meent to other EM simulation SW. \
This is only to provide technical report and discussion, not to say any tool is good or bad.

## 1. Fourier transform
convergence test with both of Discrete FT and Continuous FT.

## 2. Calculation time
time to get diffraction efficiencies from EM solver.

## 3. Eigendecomposition with CPU core limit
